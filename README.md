# HTML Deliverable
For this deliverable I built out the structure of my application using HTML.
- started with an index.hmtl, which will be my login page
- the page includes a color theme picker which may be removed, some info, a cat picture that i need to draw and update, and a login
- login button takes you to home.html
- home.html has a navbar to reload the page for home or to the login page
- added the color picker in, might make presents so i can custom make the themes
- websocket connection placeholder, tells people when they study and finish, as well as a placeholder for a chat
- made the html for the countdown clock, going to implement functionality with js
- start and pause buttons
- added an imbedded youtube playlist, will update later to make it better
- another cat that can be clicked to say different sayings, will update later
- added a to do list, so far with just an add box and check boxes
